def generate_image_tool(prompt: str, size: str = "1024x1024") -> dict:
    """
    Generates a complex, high-quality illustration image based on a given text prompt.
    The image is uploaded to storage and a link is returned along with base64 data.

    This tool is designed to generate **non-photographic, artistic, or conceptual illustrations** â€” e.g. cartoon scenes, product illustrations, infographic components, icons, or abstract art. It does not generate realistic human photographs.

    ========================
    **Supported Resolutions:**
    - '1024x1024'  (Square, default)
    - '1792x1024'  (Wide landscape)
    - '1024x1792'  (Vertical portrait)

    *Other resolutions are not supported and may return errors.*

    ========================
    **Prompt Guidelines:**
    - Be descriptive and explicit. The model responds well to detailed scene descriptions.
    - Use keywords like: "cartoon", "vector style", "digital illustration", "minimalist art", "flat design", etc.
    - Avoid requesting realistic photographs or celebrity likenesses.
    - Specify color schemes or mood where relevant (e.g. "warm colors", "blue background", "isometric view").
    - Example:  
        `"A digital illustration of a rocket ship launching, cartoon style, with colorful smoke trails, blue sky, and minimal flat design."`

    ========================
    **Arguments:**
    - prompt (str): A detailed description of the image you want generated.
    - size (str): Image resolution. Defaults to '1024x1024'. Must be one of the supported resolutions listed above.

    ========================
    **Returns:**
    - link (str): The storage URL of the uploaded image.
